<h4>What is ColonJs?</h4>
<p>ColonJs is a micro front end framework (only 3kb gzipped) and is similar to Vue.js. It can provide a lower weight alternative for simple projects, and may even be faster than other frameworks due to its tiny footprint. </p>

<h4>Using ColonJs</h4>
<p><b>CDN</b></p>
<p>Use the following code with the latest version for prototyping or for learning purposes:</p>
<pre class="hljs html">
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/colonjs"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>NPM</b></p>
<p>When building with ColonJs, it is recommended that you use the NPM installation method. It works well with module bundlers like <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>.</p>
<pre class="hljs bash">
$ npm install colonjs
</pre>
